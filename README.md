# VFS COVID API

> A RESTful API to get VFS visa application centers' info

## Synopsis

As far as I know, VFS Global does not provide a public API to check/filter the [COVID-19 page data](https://www.vfsglobal.com/en/individuals/covid-19-customer-advisories.html).

This simple application fetches the [JS file that is imported on the "COVID-19: CUSTOMER ADVISORIES" page](https://www.vfsglobal.com/en/assets/js/script.min.js), parses it, extracts the data, and exposes it via a RESTful API.


## What can I do with this?

Given you have an inquiry about VFS Global visa application centers, it can answer questions such as:

1. I'm currently residing in **Albania** can I get a visa to visit **Canada**? ([`/vfs-application-centers?from=albania&to=canada`](https://vfs-covid-api.now.sh/vfs-application-centers?from=albania&to=canada))

2. From which countries can I get a visa to visit **Australia**? ([`/vfs-application-centers?to=australia`](https://vfs-covid-api.now.sh/vfs-application-centers?to=australia))

3. Which visa application centers are currently **Open** and can process my application to visit **Germany**. ([`/vfs-application-centers?to=germany&toast_message=open`](https://vfs-covid-api.now.sh/vfs-application-centers?to=germany&toast_message=open))

For more info, have a look the API [documentation](https://vfs-covid-api.now.sh/).

## Running the server

git clone https://github.com/fardjad/node-vfs-covid-api

_Note: You'll need Node.js v12+ to run the server._
